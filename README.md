# Pokedex
This is a simple android app written in kotlin that has pokedex functionality

This app gives a list of buttons, each with the name of a unique pokemon, that will take the user to an information page with simple stats for that pokemon. The information about the pokemon is retrieved from the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) using retrofit2 (http://square.github.io/retrofit/). Any and all suggestions and/or questions are welcome.
